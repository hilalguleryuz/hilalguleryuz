## About Me

💹 As an enthusiastic and continuously developing data analyst, I am highly passionate about extracting meaningful insights from raw data and visualizing these analyses effectively. I enjoy performing detailed analysis using SQL and Excel and visualizing these analyses with Power BI and Excel.

📊 I have started my data analyst career at Turkish Airlines and worked in this role for 3.5 years. During this time, I used the Microsoft Excel to analyze raw data and create effective dashboards. To further advance my career in data analysis, I started a data analyst training course at the Kodlasam education platform.

🎯 I have been receiving data analyst training at Kodlasam for the last 9 months and in this process, I have been learning data analysis tools such as PostgreSQL, Python and Power BI in addition to Excel. During the training process, I prepare final project for the relevant program at the end of each module.
